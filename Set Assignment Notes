{23, 13. 18, 25, 6, 19, 22, 14, 9, 6}
Let's say we want to remove item '6'. 

Could use a tombstone - something once contained something, but not it's empty - not applicable to integers. The null value ref. 
could be used as a tombstone, though. 

Pointers: Null (a pointer tombstone)

Solution: 

Swap 6 with 22, and reduce the size of the array by 1. 
Could not swap - just a copy.
