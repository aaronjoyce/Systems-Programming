stdin <- keyboard (default)
stdout <- screen (default); buffered; e.g., just print to screen - could be divered to an alternative output source. 
stderr <- screen (default); not buffered; e.g., write to file. Output immediately. 

To debug:
fprintf( stderr, <all the usual code> );

fgets( line, MAX_LENGTH-1, stdin );
